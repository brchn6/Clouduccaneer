## Architecture

The web UI is built with:
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python async web framework)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (no heavy frameworks)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern design
- **Communication**: RESTful JSON API

### API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main web interface
- `GET /api/config` - Get current configuration
- `POST /api/fetch` - Download from URL
- `POST /api/search` - Search SoundCloud
- `POST /api/rename` - Rename files in folder
- `POST /api/clean` - Clean leftover files
- `POST /api/bpm` - Detect BPM of audio files

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The web UI is designed for **local use only**. 

- By default, it binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
- If you bind to `0.0.0.0` or expose to network, ensure proper firewall rules
- No authentication is built-in - use behind reverse proxy if needed
- Only download content you have rights to access

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 8080 is already taken:
```bash
cb web --port 8081
```

### Cannot Access from Other Devices
To allow access from other devices on your network:
```bash
cb web --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Static Files Not Loading
Make sure you installed CloudBuccaneer properly:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Development

The web UI code is located in:
- `src/cb/web/app.py` - FastAPI backend
- `src/cb/web/templates/index.html` - HTML interface
- `src/cb/web/static/css/style.css` - Styling
- `src/cb/web/static/js/app.js` - JavaScript functionality
